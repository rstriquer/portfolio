## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

- `npm start`: Runs the app in the development mode. Open
  [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser. The
  page will reload when you make changes. You may also see any lint errors in the
  console.

- `npm test`: Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode. See the
  section about
  [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests)
  for more information.

- `npm run predeploy`: Run the `npm run build` command. It raises warnings
  if anything is wrong with packages. Useful to run before deploy files;

- `npm run deploy`: Run the `npm run build` and deploy the code to the
  online repository.

- `npm run build`: Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It
  correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the
  best performance. The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
  Your app is ready to be deployed! See the section about
  [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for
  more information.

- `npm run eject`: Note: This is a **one-way operation**. Once you `eject`, you
  **can't go back!** If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and
  configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove
  the single build dependency from your project. Instead, it will copy all the
  configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint,
  etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the
  commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied
  scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own. You don't
  have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and
  middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature.
  However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't
  customize it when you are ready for it.
